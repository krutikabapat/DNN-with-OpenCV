# DNN-with-OpenCV
Deep neural Networks with OpenCV

## The following network architectures compatible with OpenCV 3.3 include:-

1. GoogleLeNet.  
2. AlexNet.  
3. SqueezeNet.  
4. VGGNet.  
5. ResNet.  

## For DNN with Caffe model:-

1. .prototxt file, which has model architecture.  
2. .caffemodel which has the weights of layers.  


## To run the code:-
<code> python face.py --image image.jpg --prototxt deploy.prototxt.txt --model res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel </code>
