# DNN-with-OpenCV
Deep neural Networks with OpenCV

The following network architectures compatible with OpenCV 3.3 include:-

1. GoogleLeNet.  
2. AlexNet.  
3. SqueezeNet.  
4. VGGNet.  
5. ResNet.  

For DNN with Caffe model, we are having two files:-

1. .prototxt file, which has model architecture.  
2. .caffemodel which has the weights of layers.
